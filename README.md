### 👋 Hi there, I'm Mikhail!

I'm an urban data scientist/modeller, researcher and policy analyst.

- 👨‍🔬 I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher on the Horizon 2020 project [HERoS](https://www.heros-project.eu/) at the Delft University of Technology. 
- 📈 I have a strong background in data science which I recently enhanced with simulation & modelling for policy analysis.
- 🌱 I aim to understand how cities recover, adapt, or transform in the face of uncertain future events like pandemics, heatwaves, or segregation.
- 📝 Check out our recent [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZzHyCt0AAAAJ&hl=en) to learn more about the findings from these repos.
