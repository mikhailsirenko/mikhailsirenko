### 👋 Hi there, I'm Mikhail!

I'm an urban data scientist/modeller, researcher and policy analyst.

- 🌋 I'm currently working as a Disaster Resilience Analyst at Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) at the World Bank.
- 👨‍🔬 I'm also a Postdoctoral Researcher on the Horizon 2020 project [HERoS](https://www.heros-project.eu/) at the Delft University of Technology where we build digital twins of cities to better prepare for uncertain future.
- 📈 I have a strong background in data science which I recently enhanced with simulation & modelling for [policy analysis](https://www.rand.org/pubs/notes/N3093.html).
- 🌱 I aim to understand how cities recover, adapt, or transform in the face of uncertain future events like pandemics, heatwaves, or segregation.
- 📝 Check out our recent [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZzHyCt0AAAAJ&hl=en) to learn more about the findings generated from these repos.
